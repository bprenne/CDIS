# Canadian Discharge Instruction Set (CDIS)

The Canadian Discharge Instruction Set (CDIS) is intended to be a collection of public domain instructions doctors can provide to patients who are sent home (discharged) from hospitals in Canada. While targeted primarily for discharges from the Emergency Department, these could include instructions for patients discharged from other hospital departments such as Medicine or Surgery. Instructions are given for a specific condition, general in nature, written at a grade 5 reading level or below, and kept concise. They are initially drafted by doctors and then reviewed by a panel of individuals including doctors, patient/family partners, and Indigenious partners to ensure instructions are complete, accurate, comprehensible, culturally safe, and relevant to the Canadian context. They will then be translated into a number of other languages by professional medical translators. Instructions are released into the public domain, so they may be used by anyone anywhere for any purpose, subject to the conditions of the [License](https://github.com/bprenne/CDIS/blob/main/LICENSE) and in particular conditions limiting liability: you use these instructions at your own risk and you assume all medicolegal liability if you use these instructions. 

While we aim for CDIS instructions to be useful for doctors to give to patients to help patients to manage their own care at home after leaving hospital, ultimately the medicolegal responsibility rests with the person giving the instructions in accordance with [Canadian Medical Protective Association (CMPA) guidance on informed discharge](https://www.cmpa-acpm.ca/en/education-events/good-practices/physician-patient/informed-discharge). In particular, instructions from CDIS do not replace the conversation a doctor needs to have with a patient at discharge, and the doctor needs to be sure any CDIS instructions provided to the patient are accurate, safe, and relevant to the particulars of that patient's situation and medical needs. A doctor may need to supplement CDIS instructions with additional instructions or override portions of CDIS instructions with different instructions, among other actions. Those contributing to the CDIS project in any manner do not accept any liability for use of these instructions, though contributors hope these will be useful to Canadian doctors and patients and ultimately improve discharge practice in Canada. See our [License](https://github.com/bprenne/CDIS/blob/main/LICENSE) for important legal information.

## Can patients use these instructions on their own, without having a doctor check them first?

*If you are a patient, you should not use these instructions on your own.*

These instructions are meant to be provided to you by a doctor. The doctor needs to look them over and make sure they will work for you. If you use these instructions without having a doctor check them first, they might not be right for you. This could cause you harm or even death.

If you use these instructions without having a doctor check them first, you are fully responsible for anything that may happen to you. The people involved in making the CDIS instructions will not be responsible in any way, including but not limited to medically or legally. See our [License](https://github.com/bprenne/CDIS/blob/main/LICENSE) for important legal information.

## Why undertake the CDIS project when there are other commercial or "open source" medical information resources already out there?

There are many patient resources available publicly on the Internet, including excellent commercial resources as well as resources that have various "open source" licenses permitting use with or without modification. Some institutions subscribe to databases of patient instructions for various medical conditions. It is reasonable to ask why we might undertake the CDIS project as opposed to simply recommending the use of one or more of these other resources.

First, Canadians have and believe in a publically funded healthcare system and in healthcare as a human right. Many of the aforementioned commercial entities are based outside of Canada. We do not think it is right to send public money, often amounting to tens of thousands of dollars per institution per year, outside of Canada just so we can have a written collection of basic information on self-care that is common knowledge among doctors. We would prefer this money be freed up so it can be used to fund direct patient care, and we hope that CDIS will be a resource that can eventually replace these commercial products.

Second, while there are other "open source" patient instruction collections that can be used and/or modified freely, many of these have licenses that require giving credit and citations to the original authors/entities or that forbid the use of the work for commercial purposes. We believe many of these resources are excellent and their creators should get credit for their hard work. However, we believe that information on self-care of medical conditions is not something that should be owned by or credited primarily to a specific individual, group of people, or entity. Knowing how to care for ourselves as informed by medical science is part of the human condition. No one should "own" this information. Further, if someone wants to take this information and make a commercial product out of it, they should be free to do so and allowed to modify it as they see fit, though we would hope that our institutions would be wise enough to carefully consider whether public money should go to such a commercial entity, as per the discussion above. In essence, we believe this information should be "public domain": no one should own or control it.

The CDIS project is meant to be a starting point for the conversation doctors have with their patients and a source that others can use to develop their own projects or enterprises if they wish. The only caveat is that, despite our efforts to make this information accurate and useful, CDIS accepts no medicolegal responsibilty for the use of its information. As the primary intent of this information is to provide a resource to facilitate [the conversation doctors should have with their patients](https://www.cmpa-acpm.ca/en/education-events/good-practices/physician-patient/informed-discharge), ultimately the medicolegal responsibility rests with anyone who uses this information. See our [License](https://github.com/bprenne/CDIS/blob/main/LICENSE) for important legal information.

## Status of the project

At present we are in the drafting stage for a preliminary set of instructions that will be translated into a few select languages. Instructions were chosen to be common conditions seen and discharged from the Emergency Department based on the experience of the CDIS project initiators. Languges were chosen to include the official languages of Canada (English and French) in addition to the most prevalent languages in Saskatchewan, where the project began. 

We aim to eventually expand our set of languages and instructions, with an eventual goal of making them relatively comprehensive to the Canadian context.
