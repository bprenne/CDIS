# Anaphylaxis

## What is wrong?
- Anaphylaxis ("an-uh-fuh-LAK-sis") is a dangerous allergic reaction. It can be deadly.
- Anaphylaxis happens if you eat or touch something you are severely allergic to. Examples are some foods, some medications, insect stings or bites, and latex. Sometimes we can't be sure what caused it.
- Some symptoms are trouble breathing, swelling in the face or mouth, chest tightness, stomach upset, and fainting. You may only have some of these, and the ones you get can be different each time.
- If you have anaphylaxis, you must immediately take a medication called epinephrine. Outside of the hospital, this often comes in a pen-shaped container called EpiPen.

## What should I do at home?
- Get plenty of rest and take any medications the doctor told you to take.
- Avoid the things you are allergic to. If you're not sure what caused your anaphylaxis, avoid things that might have caused it.
- Use your EpiPen right away if you:
    - have trouble breathing,
    - swelling of your tongue, lips, or throat,
    - can't stop coughing or get a new wheeze that doesn't stop, or
    - are having lots of different symptoms (new rash, stomach upset, feeling faint).
- If you are not sure if you should use your EpiPen, use it. It can be life-saving and it is better to be safe.
- After using your EpiPen, you must go to the Emergency Department right away, even if you are feeling better. You can get much worse and even die, so a doctor needs to monitor you until you are safe. Call 911 or have someone take you. Do not drive yourself.

## When will I feel better?
- Most people feel better in a few days.
- A second anaphylaxis can occur within 2 days of the first, even if you avoid the things you are allergic to. If this happens, use your EpiPen right away.

## You should see a family doctor or go to a walk-in clinic:
- To discuss your reaction with a family doctor and be sure you can get more EpiPens.
- To see if you should get tested to find out what you are allergic to.

## Go to the Emergency Department right away if:
- You are having trouble breathing, having chest tightness or pain, or you pass out.
- You get swelling in your lips, mouth, or throat.
- You used your EpiPen, even if you're feeling better after using it.
- Call 911 or have someone take you. Do not drive yourself.
