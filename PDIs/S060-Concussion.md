# Concussion

## What is wrong?
- A concussion is a mild brain injury. It happens when your head is hit or shaken hard.
- You don't have to pass out to have a concussion. Medical imaging like CT scan, MRI, or X-ray will not show any damage to the brain.
- Concussion can cause trouble thinking or remembering things, headache, fuzzy vision, dizziness, and strong emotions.
- With the right treatment, most people get better in a few weeks. Some symptoms can last longer.

## What should I do at home?
- Rest. Don't read, watch videos or TV, play sports, exercise, work, or think too hard.
- Don't use alcohol, drugs, or any medications except those a doctor told you to take. These can make you feel worse.
- After a few days, you can try reading or watching videos. If this makes you feel worse, stop and rest.
- Don't take aspirin, drive, or operate tools or machinery until a doctor says you can.

## When will I feel better?
- Most people feel better within 1 month, but some symptoms can last longer.
- People who have had concussions before sometimes take longer to get better.

## You should see a doctor:
- See your family doctor or go to a walk-in clinic in about 1 week to learn the next steps to getting better.
- Ask the doctor when you can return to work, sports, or other activities.

## Call 911 or have someone take you to the Emergency Department if:
- You vomit more than 2 times.
- You are sleepy and it is hard to wake you up.
- You have a seizure (loss of awareness and shaking).
- You can't speak, move part of your body, or your face is drooping.
- You become very confused or are acting strangely.
