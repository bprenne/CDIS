# Laceration (cut) with stitches that fall out on their own (absorbable)

## What is wrong?
- You got a cut that was closed with stitches. These will help it heal and look better.

## What should I do at home?
- Keep the cut dry for 1 day.
- After 1 day, you can wash your cut with soap and water once a day or if it gets dirty. Be gentle so you don't open it up.
- After you wash it, pat it dry and cover it with a clean bandage.
- Don't soak your cut in water (such as a bathtub, sink, pool, or hot tub) until it is completely healed and the stitches are out.
- Try to avoid doing things that could open up the cut.

## When will I feel better?
- Most cuts start to feel better in a couple of days.
- You have a special kind of sutures that will fall out on your own (absorbable) within 5 to 10 days.
- It will take 1 to 2 weeks for your cut to heal completely. There will usually be a scar.

## Go to a walk-in clinic or the Emergency Department if you have:
- You have a temperature of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or higher or are feeling very sick.
- There is redness spreading from around the cut.
- There is pus or a bad smell coming from the cut.
- There is a lot of swelling or much worse pain around the cut.
- Your stitches or staples break or fall out early and the cut opens up.
