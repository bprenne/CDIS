# Laceration (cut) with glue

## What is wrong?
You got a cut that was closed with medical glue. This will help it heal and look better.

## What should I do at home?
- The glue will fall off on its own in 5 to 10 days.
- Try to avoid doing things that could pull off the glue early or open up the cut.
- After 1 day, you can gently wash your cut with water but be careful not to take the glue off. After you wash it, pat it dry.
- Don't soak your cut in water (such as a bathtub, sink, pool, or hot tub) until it is completely healed and the glue has fallen off.

## When will I feel better?
- Most cuts start to feel better in a couple of days.
- It will take 1 to 2 weeks for your cut to heal completely. There will usually be a scar.

## Go to a walk-in clinic or the Emergency Department if you have:
- You have a temperature of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or higher or are feeling very sick.
- There is redness spreading from around the cut.
- There is pus or a bad smell coming from the cut.
- There is a lot of swelling or much worse pain around the cut.
- Your glue comes off early and the cut opens up.
