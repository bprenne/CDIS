# Gastrointestinal Bleed (GI Bleed)

A gastrointestinal bleed (GI Bleed) is any bleeding that starts anywhere from the mouth to the large bowel. Bleeding can range from a small amount to a large amount. The larger the amount of bleeding, the more likely you are to become quite sick.

There are two types of GI bleeds:
- **Upper GI bleed**: Bleeding from the throat to the bottom of the stomach.
- **Lower GI bleed**: Bleeding from the bottom of the stomach to the end of the lower bowel or rectum.

## How Do I Know When I Have a Bleed?

The blood is digested as it moves through your digestive tract. The longer it takes to move through, the less it will look like blood because it is only partly digested. 

- **Black and tarry stool**: Indicates blood from the stomach.
- **Red or dark red stool**: Blood that has moved quickly through the digestive tract.

Small amounts of bright red blood on the surface of the stool or toilet paper may result from:
- Anal fissures or hemorrhoids.
- Irritation from diarrhea or straining during bowel movements.

This is not serious if there is only a small amount of blood and if the bleeding stops. Home treatment is usually sufficient in such cases.

## How to Take Care of Yourself at Home

Follow these instructions and take any prescribed medicines:

### Things to Stay Away From:
- **Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs** (e.g., ibuprofen): Can irritate the stomach, erode the gut lining, and thin the blood.
- **Alcohol**: Can damage the liver, thin the blood, and irritate the stomach.
- **Smoking**: Can damage the lining of the throat and stomach.
- **Caffeine**: Increases stomach acid production. Examples include coffee (including decaf), tea, cola drinks, chocolate, and other caffeinated foods and drinks.

### Things to Reduce Your Risk of a Bleed:
- Eat small meals more frequently.
- Check with your pharmacist before taking any over-the-counter medicines.
- Reduce stress, as greater stress increases the risk.

## When to Get Help

Go to the nearest Emergency Department or see your family doctor if you experience any of the following:
- Stools are black and tarry.
- Stools are bright red or dark red.

### Note:
Some foods and medicines can change the stool's appearance:
- **Black stool**: May result from bismuth subsalicylate (e.g., Pepto-Bismol) or iron tablets.
- **Red stool**: May result from eating beets.

If you are older than 50, talk with your doctor any time you have new rectal bleeding or notice blood on your stools. You may need further tests to rule out a more serious problem.

## Recommended Follow-Up

- Follow up with your primary care provider in 1 week.
