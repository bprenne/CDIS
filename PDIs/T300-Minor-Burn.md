# Burn

## What is wrong?
- A burn is when your skin gets hurt by heat, chemicals, electricity, or radiation.
- A burn is "first-degree" (or "superficial") if it only affects the top layer of skin. These burns are less serious. Deeper burns are more serious.

## What should I do at home?
- Change the bandage every day or whenever it gets dirty or wet. Do this with clean hands.
- When you change the bandage, wash the burn with water, pat it dry, put on antibiotic cream, and put on a new bandage.
- If the burn is on an arm or leg, raise the burn above the level of your heart. This can help with swelling.
- For pain, you can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin), unless a doctor says you shouldn't take these. Talk to a pharmacist for advice on these.
- Don't pop burn blisters. This can cause an infection.

## When will I feel better?
- First-degree burns usually heal within a week. Deeper burns can take 3 weeks or more to heal.

## You should see a doctor again if:
- Your burn is not better within 3 weeks.

## Go to a walk-in clinic or the Emergency Department if:
- You cannot control your pain at home with medications and rest.
- You get a temperature of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or higher, there is pus, redness spreads outward from the burn, or you have a lot more pain.
