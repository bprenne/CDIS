# RhIg (WinRho) in Early Pregnancy

Hemolytic disease of fetus and newborn (HDFN) is a disease in which the pregnant person forms antibodies against red cell proteins (antigens) of the fetus. These red cell antibodies made by the pregnant person cross placenta, enter fetal blood circulation and break down red cells in the fetus. This causes low hemoglobin (anemia), jaundice and other long term health issues in the fetus and newborn. Anti-D is a red cell antibody known to cause severe HDFN.

The red cell antibodies are produced by the pregnant personâ€™s immune system when it gets exposed to fetal red cells. Mixing of fetal blood with that of pregnant person happens in the pregnancy and increases with increasing fetal size. Mixing also increases with events such as pregnancy loss, termination of pregnancy and bleeding in pregnancy.

In Rh negative pregnant people, anti-D formation can be stopped by a medication known as RhIg. It clears away any RhD positive red cells from fetus present in the blood of Rh negative person. In doing so, it stops the immune system of Rh negative person from forming anti-D.  RhIg is given to all Rh negative pregnancies in the third trimester and after the birth of an RhD positive newborn. RhIg is also given after events which increase the risk of fetal and maternal blood mixing.

Routine administration of RhIg to Rh negative pregnancies has decreased the risk of anti-D formation and severe HDFN from 15-20% down to 0.1% in developed countries.

In early pregnancy, the amount of blood produced by fetus is very small. The chances that it will enter blood of pregnant person and activate their immune system to produce anti-D are very low. As a result, national and international obstetrical experts consider it safe to not give RhIg for bleeding, pregnancy losses and termination happening before 10-12 weeks of pregnancy. This has also been confirmed by recent research in a large number of Rh negative pregnancies.  Obstetrical specialists and family physicians in Saskatchewan collectively agree that starting RhIg administration for bleeding, pregnancy loss or termination at 10 weeks and 0 days of pregnancy is safe to stop anti-D formation.

You may have received RhIg between 8-10 weeks in your previous pregnancy if you had bleeding or pregnancy loss. We have changed these recommendations for Saskatchewan as outlined above.  If you request that RhIg be given to you in the time period of 8-10 weeks, we will honor that request as it is a medication that is safe.
