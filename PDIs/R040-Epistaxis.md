# Nosebleed (Epistaxis)

## What is wrong?
- Small blood vessels in your nose break and bleed.
- This can happen if you pick your nose, blow your nose too hard, or if the air is dry.
- Nosebleeds are usually not serious. You can often stop them at home with the right care.

## How can I stop a nosebleed at home?
- Lean your head forward so blood doesn't run down your throat.
- Pinch your nose closed hard on both sides. You pinch on the soft lower part of your nose, not the hard upper part.
- Pinch for at least 15 minutes straight. Don't stop early to check because then it might not stop bleeding.
- If it doesn't stop bleeding after 15 minutes, try pinching again for another 15 minutes.
- If it stops, avoid blowing your nose hard, heavy lifting, or straining for at least 1 day.
- If it won't stop after pinching 30 minutes total, go to a walk-in clinic or the Emergency Department.

## When should I feel better?
- Most nosebleeds stop within 30 minutes with the right care.
- It will take your nose a few days to heal.
- If the air is dry, use a humidifier while you sleep. This may prevent some nosebleeds.
- You can also put petroleum jelly (Vaseline) in your nose once or twice a day for a few days. This may also help prevent some nosebleeds.

## See a doctor or nurse if you have packing in your nose:
- If a doctor or nurse put packing in your nose, it needs to come out in 1 to 3 days. Leaving it in longer can make you sick.

## Go to a walk-in clinic or the Emergency Department right away if:
- Blood is going down your throat and making it hard to breathe.
- You are having pain, heaviness, or tightness in your chest.
- You are feeling faint or getting very pale.
- The bleeding won't stop after pinching for a total of 30 minutes.
