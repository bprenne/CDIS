# Ankle sprain

## What is wrong?
- You twisted or turned your ankle too far. This hurt some of the stretchy bands (ligaments) that hold your ankle bones together.
- This causes pain and swelling in your ankle.

## What should I do at home?
- Protect your ankle: use crutches or another walking aid to avoid putting too much weight on your hurt ankle. As your ankle gets better, use the crutches or walking aid less.
- Start walking as soon as you can. Make sure to step so you land on your heel and then roll your foot forward to push away from the toe.
- Ice your ankle for 15 minutes every 2 hours. Use a cloth so the ice does not touch your skin directly. Ice especially for the first 6 hours or if your ankle swells or hurts more. Sometimes it can help to ice on and off for up to 2 days.
- Elevate your ankle above the level of your heart when you sit or lay down. You can use pillows to prop it up.
- Unless a doctor tells you not to, you can take medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) for pain. Talk to a pharmacist for advice on these.
- If you can, see a physiotherapist (PT) to get advice on exercises to help build up your ankle strength.

## When will I feel better?
- It can take 4 to 6 weeks for your ankle to heal. It can take even longer to get back to full strength.

## You should see your family doctor or go to a walk-in clinic if:
- Your ankle isn't improving within 4 to 6 weeks.
- Your swelling or pain is getting worse.

## Go to the Emergency Department right away if:
- You have swelling, redness, or pain in your calf on one side.
- You are having trouble breathing, chest tightness, or you pass out.
- Your foot or toes turn blue or go completely numb.
