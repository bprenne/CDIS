# Fracture of distal radius (wrist fracture)

## What is wrong?
- You broke a bone in your wrist called the radius. This usually happens if you fall on your hand.
- Your doctor put the bone back in place and wrapped your wrist in a splint (or cast).

## What should I do at home?
- Keep the splint dry. Cover it with plastic if you need to wash your body.
- Apply ice to your wrist for 15 minutes every 2 hours. Cover the ice with plastic or a towel so your splint doesn't get wet. Ice helps most in the first 2 days.
- Raise your wrist above the level of your heart when you can. This will help with swelling.
- Unless a doctor tells you not to, you can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) for pain. Ask a pharmacist for advice on these.
- Don't slide anything inside the splint. If you get an itch, you can use a fan to blow cool air inside the splint.
- Avoid smoking. Smoking slows down the healing of your bones.

## When will I feel better?
- It usually takes 4 to 6 weeks for your bone to heal completely. Stiffness and swelling can last longer.

## You need to see a doctor again:
- See a doctor in about 1 week for an x-ray.

## Go to a walk-in clinic or the Emergency Department if:
- You cannot control your pain with medication, ice, and raising your wrist above your heart.
- Your fingers turn blue or go completely numb.
- Your splint is hurting you or it is too tight.
- Your splint gets wet and changes shape or does not dry completely.
