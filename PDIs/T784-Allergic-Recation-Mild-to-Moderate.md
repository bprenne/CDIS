# Allergic Reaction (Not Severe)

## What is wrong?
- You had a reaction to something you are allergic to. While uncomfortable, this was not life-threatening.
- Some common causes are pollen, dust, mold, animal hair or dander, some foods, some medicines, or insect stings or bites. Sometimes we don't know what you are allergic to.
- Symptoms can include watery or itchy eyes, runny nose, sneezing, coughing, itchy skin, or rash (hives).

## What should I do at home?
- If you know what you are allergic to, try and avoid these things.
- Rest. Don't smoke. Avoid strong smells, air pollution, or cold air.
- Unless a doctor tells you not to, you could try antihistamine medication. Examples: diphenhydramine (Benadryl), loratadine (Claritin), fexofenadine (Allegra), or cetirizine (Reactine). Ask a pharmacist to help you choose and to go over side effects.

## When will I feel better?
- Most people feel better in 1 to 3 days.

## You should see a doctor again if:
- You are not feeling better within 3 days.
- Your symptoms are getting worse.
- You don't know what you are allergic to and you want testing to find out.

## Go to the Emergency Department right away if you have:
- You are having trouble breathing, having chest tightness or pain, or you pass out.
- You get swelling in your lips, mouth, or throat.
- Call 911 or have someone take you. Do not drive yourself.
