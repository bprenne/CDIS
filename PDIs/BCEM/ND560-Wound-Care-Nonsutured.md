# Wound Care (Non-Sutured)

Cuts, scratches, scrapes, and bruises are common injuries that typically heal on their own. Bruises form when small blood vessels in the skin or deeper tissues are broken without cutting the skin.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

### For Cuts, Scratches, and Scrapes:
- Apply pressure for 20 minutes to stop any bleeding.
- Clean the wound once daily with warm water.
- Avoid using alcohol on open wounds, as it stings and damages tissue.
- Do not pick at scabs; let them fall off naturally.
- Keep the wound clean and dry until healing begins.
- If using a bandage, change it daily or when it becomes dirty.

### For Bruises:
- Use ice packs wrapped in a towel for 10â€“15 minutes to reduce bleeding under the skin and ease pain.
- Elevate the injured area (e.g., place a limb on a pillow or footstool).

## When to Get Help

See your family doctor or visit a walk-in clinic if:
- Bleeding does not stop after 20 minutes of pressure.
- Signs of infection appear:
  - Redness or swelling around the wound.
  - Increasing pain or tenderness.
  - White, yellow, or green discharge (pus).
- The wound does not heal within 20 days.
- You develop a fever.
- Red streaks appear on the skin around the wound.

## Recommended Follow-Up
- Follow up with your primary care provider within the specified timeframe.
