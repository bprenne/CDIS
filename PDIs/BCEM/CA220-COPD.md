# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, a long-term disease caused by permanent damage to the lungs, most often due to cigarette smoke. A COPD exacerbation or flare involves worsening shortness of breath, increased sputum production, or thicker and greener sputum.

Treatment for COPD works gradually over time and requires consistent management.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

- If prescribed antibiotics and prednisone (a steroid), take the full course of both:
  - Prednisone is helpful for your lungs. In the short term, it may cause mood changes, increased appetite, or difficulty sleeping. If sleep issues occur, take prednisone in the morning.
- Continue using long-acting puffers like Spiriva or Advair.
- During a COPD exacerbation, add a short-acting puffer like:
  - **Ventolin (salbutamol, blue puffer)** or **Atrovent (ipratropium, green puffer)**.
  - Take two puffs every four hours while awake for the next couple of days, then as needed.
  - If the puffer hasn’t been used recently (Atrovent: 3 days, Ventolin: 14 days), prime it before use by pressing the button four times away from your face.
- To use the puffer:
  - Breathe out, place your lips on the puffer, and breathe in gradually and fully as you press the button.
- Drink plenty of water, avoid smoky environments, and get your flu vaccination.
- If you smoke, consider quitting programs (see "Relevant Resources" below).
- Avoid using e-cigarettes, vape pens, or related products.

## When to Get Help

Go to the nearest Emergency Department if:
- You cannot speak a full sentence while sitting down.
- Your shortness of breath worsens compared to when you left the ED.
- You develop a fever (38.0°C/100.4°F or higher) after two days of taking antibiotics or have a new fever.
- You experience increased confusion.

### Call 9-1-1 if you are unable to safely get to the Emergency Department.

## Recommended Follow-Up

- Follow up with your primary care provider within 1 week.
