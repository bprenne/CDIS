# Miscarriage

Miscarriages are common, occurring in as many as 1 in 4 pregnancies. They are often caused by random genetic abnormalities when the egg and sperm join. It is important to know that a miscarriage is not caused by food, exercise, activity, or stress.

### Symptoms
- Vaginal bleeding, often similar to a heavy period.
- Passing blood clots or tissue.
- Lower abdominal cramps or pain, which can range from mild (like period cramps) to severe.

## Treatment Options

1. **Expectant Management**:
   - Allow the miscarriage to resolve naturally.

2. **Medical Management**:
   - Medication (oral or vaginal) can help pass pregnancy tissue more quickly.

3. **Surgical Management**:
   - Surgery (D&C) may be necessary for ongoing heavy bleeding, signs of infection, or when other methods fail.

### Additional Care:
- Women with certain blood types (A, B, or O negative) will receive an injection of Rhogam to prevent complications in future pregnancies.

## Recovering from a Miscarriage

- Bleeding typically resolves within 1–2 weeks, and pain subsides once all pregnancy tissue has passed.
- Breasts may become swollen and painful, sometimes leaking milk, for a few days to weeks.
- Menstrual periods usually return in 4–6 weeks.
- Emotional recovery may take longer. Feelings of loss, sadness, guilt, or anger are common. Take the time you need to heal.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

- Take prescribed medications, including pain relief such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil).
- Use sanitary pads instead of tampons until bleeding stops.
- Avoid sexual intercourse, baths, and vaginal douches until cleared by your doctor.
- For lactation discomfort:
  - Use cold compresses to reduce pain and swelling.
  - Wear a supportive bra.
  - Allow breasts to leak in the shower to relieve pressure.
  - Avoid heat and breast pumping; hand express only enough to relieve discomfort.
- Attend follow-up ultrasounds, bloodwork, and appointments as advised.

## When to Get Help

### Go to the Emergency Department if:
- You soak 1 or more maxi pads per hour.
- Pain is not controlled by prescribed medication.
- You feel faint or dizzy.

### See Your Family Doctor if:
- Bleeding lasts longer than 2 weeks.
- You develop a fever or foul-smelling discharge.
- Breasts become hard, red, painful, and you have a fever.
- You have severe one-sided abdominal pain.
- You have emotional difficulty or trouble sleeping or eating after a few weeks.

## Recommended Follow-Up
- Follow up with your primary care provider within 1–2 weeks.
