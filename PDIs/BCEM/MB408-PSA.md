# Procedural Sedation and Analgesia (PSA)

PSA medications help you feel relaxed and sleepy, provide pain relief, and may make you forget the procedure. You might be able to follow instructions during the procedure but may not remember it afterwards.

Your healthcare team, including an emergency physician, nurse, and respiratory technician, monitored you during the procedure.
