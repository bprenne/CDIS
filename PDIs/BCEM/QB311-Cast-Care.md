# Cast or Splint Care

A cast or splint supports and protects an injured part of your body. It keeps the injured area from moving, allowing it to heal faster. The type of cast or splint and the duration of use depend on the injury.

### Types of Casts or Splints:
- **Plaster Cast**: 
  - Takes at least a day to dry and harden.
  - Do not put pressure on the cast during this time. If on your leg and weight-bearing is allowed, wait at least 3 days.

- **Fibreglass Cast**: 
  - Dries quickly and is stronger and lighter than plaster.
  - Weight-bearing may begin immediately if advised.

- **Plaster Splint**:
  - A back-half cast held in place with a tensor bandage, used when swelling is present.
  - Takes at least a day to dry and harden. Use minimal weight until a full cast is applied or weight-bearing is approved.

- **Metal Splint**:
  - Holds a finger or hand in a specific position.
  - Do not bend or alter the splint’s shape. The tape keeps it secure.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

### Keep the Cast or Splint Dry:
- To bathe or shower:
  - Wrap the cast or splint with a towel.
  - Cover with a plastic bag and tape the opening to prevent water entry.
- If a **plaster cast or splint** gets wet, soft, or cracked, see your family doctor.
- If a **fibreglass cast or splint** gets wet:
  - Wipe the exterior dry.
  - Use cool air from a hair dryer if the interior is wet.
  - If cracked, see your family doctor.

### Dealing with Itchy Skin:
- Blow cool air from a hair dryer into the cast.
- Do not use powders or lotions under the cast or splint.

### DO NOT:
- Insert objects into the cast or splint.
- Trim, reshape, or remove the cast or splint.
- Hit the cast or splint against hard surfaces.

### Care of Your Injury:
- Take pain medicine as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.
- Elevate the injured arm or leg above the heart to reduce swelling and ease pain (use pillows when sitting or lying).
- If you have an arm cast, use a sling while walking.
- Wiggle your fingers or toes often, except if a metal splint is applied.

## When to Get Help

Go to the nearest Emergency Department if you experience:
- Severe or increasing pain that doesn’t improve with repositioning or pain medicine.

  - Turn blue or grey.

- Numbness or tingling in the hand or foot.
- A burning, stinging sensation under the cast or splint.
- A bad smell from the cast or splint.
- Fever over 38.5°C (101.3°F) and chills.
