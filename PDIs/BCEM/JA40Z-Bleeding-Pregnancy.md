# First Trimester Bleeding in Pregnancy

Vaginal bleeding or spotting in the first trimester occurs in 15â€“25% of pregnancies. Not all women who experience first-trimester bleeding will have a miscarriage. There are various potential causes for bleeding during early pregnancy.

## What to Expect
- Your doctor has checked for dangerous causes of first-trimester bleeding.
- Follow-up tests may be needed, as the cause may not be clear during your first visit.
- If your **beta-HCG (pregnancy hormone)** level is too low for ultrasound diagnosis, you may require further blood tests or ultrasounds to monitor the progression of your pregnancy.

## Causes of Vaginal Bleeding
1. **Implantation bleeding**: Normal bleeding as the fertilized egg implants into the uterine lining.
2. **Miscarriage**: Loss of a non-viable pregnancy.
3. **Subchorionic hematoma**: Bleeding under tissue layers surrounding the embryo.
4. **Ectopic pregnancy**: Fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, which can lead to dangerous bleeding.
5. **Infection**: Infections in the uterus or bladder.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home
- There are no specific activities or treatments (e.g., bed rest) proven to prevent or reduce the risk of miscarriage.

## When to Get Help
Go to the nearest Emergency Department if you experience:
- Heavy bleeding (soaking through a pad or tampon every hour for more than 2 hours).
- Severe abdominal pain.
- Chest pain or shortness of breath.
- Fainting, lightheadedness, or dizziness.
- Fever.
- Nausea and vomiting beyond usual pregnancy-related symptoms.
