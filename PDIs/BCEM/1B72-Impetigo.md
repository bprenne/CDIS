# Impetigo

Impetigo is a skin infection caused by **Staphylococcus aureus (staph)** or **Group A Streptococcus (strep)** bacteria. It is more common in children, particularly during summer, and often occurs when bacteria enter the skin through cuts, cold sores, insect bites, or eczema patches.

## Symptoms
- Rash resembling small blisters or red bumps.
- Blisters burst, releasing fluid that dries into a yellow or grey crust.
- Rash often appears:
  - Around the nose, mouth, and face.
  - On exposed skin like arms and legs.
- Severe cases may involve:
  - Swollen lymph glands in the face or neck.
  - Pain, worsening redness, weakness, or fever.

With proper treatment, impetigo typically resolves in about 7 days.

## How is it Spread?
Impetigo spreads easily through:
- Skin-to-skin contact or touching contaminated surfaces.
- Nasal discharge from an infected person.
- Sharing towels, clothes, bedding, or personal items like combs.

Symptoms usually appear 1–10 days after exposure.

## Is Impetigo Serious?
Impetigo is usually mild, causing occasional itching. Rarely, the bacteria can enter the bloodstream and cause kidney disease.

## How Can Parents Help?
- **Keep your child at home**:
  - Prevent spreading impetigo at daycare, school, or camps.
  - Children can return after 24 hours of antibiotic treatment.
- **Limit contact**:
  - Reduce exposure to infected children and monitor for symptoms.
- **Practice good hygiene**:
  - Wash hands often, especially after physical contact with sores.
  - Wash the child’s clothes and linens separately in hot water and dry them in a hot dryer.
- **Discourage touching sores**:
  - Keep fingernails short and clean.
  - Encourage frequent handwashing.

## Treatment
- Use antibiotic cream as prescribed. Oral antibiotics may be necessary for widespread rashes.
- Complete the full antibiotic course, even if symptoms improve.
- To clean crusts:
  - Soak them for 15–20 minutes with a warm, wet cloth.
  - Wash gently with soap and water, then pat dry.

## When to Get Help
- Contact your family doctor if you suspect your child has impetigo.
- For severe symptoms, consult your healthcare provider promptly.
