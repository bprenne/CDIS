# Corneal Abrasion

A corneal abrasion is a common injury that occurs when the clear covering of the front part of the eye is scratched or poked. Common causes include tree branches, fingernails, mascara brushes, hair brushes, contact lenses, and paper edges. Symptoms include:

- Eye pain.
- A sensation of something in the eye or under the lid.
- Watery eye.
- Sensitivity to light.

Small corneal abrasions usually heal within 1â€“2 days. Larger or deeper abrasions may take about a week. Your vision will not be permanently affected.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

- Rest your eyes and avoid bright lights, reading, or sitting too close to screens. Wear sunglasses as needed.
- If the injury was caused by a contact lens:
  - Do not wear your contacts for at least 7 days, even if your eye feels better.
- For minor pain, use over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil).
- If prescribed eye drops or ointment, use them as directed.

## When to Get Help

Go to the nearest Emergency Department or Urgent Care if:

- Your eye pain worsens.
- Your vision deteriorates.
- You develop a fever.

## Recommended Follow-Up

- Follow up with your primary care provider within 1 week.
