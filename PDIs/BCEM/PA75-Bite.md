# Animal and Human Bites

## When to Get Help

Go to the nearest Emergency Department or Urgent Care Centre if you experience:
- Fever, chills, or flu-like symptoms.
- Increased swelling, redness, or warmth, especially if spreading towards the heart.
- Increased levels of pain.
- Yellow/green drainage of fluid from the wound (pus) or a foul smell.

These are signs of infection, and you should see a healthcare provider as soon as possible.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

Proper care is important for preventing infection and promoting healing.

### Wound Care

#### Cleaning
- Wash the area with soap and water, pat dry with a clean cloth or gauze.
- Cover the wound using a sterile bandage and change daily or as directed by your doctor.
- If the wound is healing without irritation, you can remove the dressings after 48 hours.

#### Stitches
- Your healthcare team may have decided to stitch your wound closed.
- Keep the stitches dry for the first 24 hours, then follow the cleaning instructions above.
- Protect your stitches by avoiding activities that may pull or strain them (e.g., weightlifting or vigorous exercise).

For further information on caring for your stitches, refer to the ECBC Wound Care resource.

### Treatment

#### Antibiotics
- Topical or oral antibiotics may be prescribed depending on your bite wound to treat or prevent infection.

#### Immunizations
- You may receive a tetanus shot if needed.
- You may have also received a rabies shot if you were bitten by a bat.

#### Pain Management
- Over-the-counter medication such as acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol®) or ibuprofen (e.g., Advil®, Motrin®) can be taken for pain or discomfort.
- Avoid taking aspirin for pain as it can increase bleeding risk unless directed by your doctor.
- If you were prescribed pain medication, ask your primary care provider or pharmacist if you can take medications for pain prior to using them.

## Prevention

- Avoid provoking animals: Some animals may attack if they feel threatened. Use caution with unfamiliar animals.
- Pet vaccination: Ensure pets are properly vaccinated and trained to avoid bites.
- Medical attention: Seek assistance if bitten by an animal or human as soon as possible.

## Recommended Follow-Up

- Follow up with your primary care provider in 1 week.
