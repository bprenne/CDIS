# Atrial Fibrillation (AF)

Arrhythmia is the medical term for an abnormal heart rhythm or irregular heartbeat. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common type of arrhythmia. In Canada, about 350,000 people have AF. Even if a person doesn’t feel the fast, irregular heartbeat, it’s still serious because it can lead to other problems, such as stroke and heart failure.

AF affects everyone differently. Some people with a fast heart rate may feel unwell, while others may not feel the AF at all. AF is more common among older adults, but AF without known heart disease is more common in people under 60 years.

## Symptoms of AF

With AF, the heart pumps quickly and irregularly, causing various symptoms:
- Palpitations or feeling like your heart is racing.
- Feeling very tired or having no energy.
- An irregular heartbeat or pulse rate.
- Feeling short of breath or weak with little physical effort.
- Sweating.
- Feeling anxious.
- Trouble concentrating.

### Less Common Symptoms:
- Nausea.
- Fainting or temporary loss of consciousness.
- Increased urination (passing water).

Some people have no symptoms, and AF may only be detected by a healthcare provider during a pulse or heart rate check.

## Common Causes of AF

Certain conditions make people more likely to develop AF:
- High blood pressure.
- Heart valve disease.
- Diseases of the heart muscle (e.g., congestive heart failure).
- Blockage in the arteries of the heart.
- Heart defects present at birth.
- Heart surgery or inflammation of the heart muscle or surrounding sac.
- Other arrhythmias.
- Sleep apnea.
- Lung disease.
- Viral illness.

### Triggers:
- Exercising too hard.
- Drinking too much alcohol.
- Stressful environments.
- Drinking more than three 8 oz cups of coffee or energy drinks.
- Dehydration.
- Nicotine or cigarettes.
- Lack of sleep.
- Foods containing MSG (monosodium glutamate).

## How Is AF Diagnosed?

AF is diagnosed through:
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)**: Identifies arrhythmia.
- **Echocardiogram**: Ultrasound image showing heart structure and valve abnormalities.
- **Blood tests**.
- **Holter monitor**: Records heart's electrical activity during normal activities.

## Is AF Harmful or Dangerous?

AF is usually not life-threatening, but it can lead to serious complications, including:
- **Stroke**: A sudden lack of blood flow to the brain caused by blood clots.
- **Heart failure**: The heart’s inability to pump blood effectively, leading to congestion in the lungs and tissues.
- **Decreased quality of life**: Symptoms may prevent normal activities and require frequent emergency care visits.

## When to Get Help

### Go to the nearest Emergency Department if:
- You feel dizzy, faint, weak, or unusually tired.
- You have shortness of breath for several hours or chest pain.

## Recommended Follow-Up

- Follow up with your primary care provider within 1 week.
