# Vertigo

Vertigo is a common condition that causes the sensation of spinning or whirling. You may feel as if your head or the room is spinning. It can make standing or walking difficult and may cause nausea.

## Causes

Vertigo has a variety of causes. Your doctor may arrange tests to determine the cause, but this is not always necessary. The focus is often on managing symptoms after a clinical assessment.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

When you feel unwell:

- Lie down for a minute or two until the sensation passes.
- Keep your head elevated on a pillow when lying down. Avoid lying flat on your back, as it may worsen vertigo.
- Take slow, deep breaths.
- Sit up slowly and stay seated for 1â€“2 minutes before standing.
- Stand up and move slowly.
- Turn your whole body instead of just your head when moving.
- Take prescribed medications as directed.
- Try the Epley Maneuver if advised by your healthcare provider.

### Safety Tips

For one (1) week after your symptoms resolve:

- **DO NOT**:
  - Drive.
  - Operate large machinery.
  - Climb ladders or engage in activities involving height.

To prevent falls or injuries:

- Keep your home free of tripping hazards (e.g., rugs, electrical cords).
- Use nonslip mats in the bath/shower.
- Hold handrails when using stairs.
- Use a walking aid (e.g., cane, walker) if needed.
