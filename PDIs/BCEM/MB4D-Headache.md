# Headache

Most headaches are temporary and caused by tension in the muscles of the forehead and back of the head, fatigue, eye strain, or emotional stress. Other causes include infection, injury, allergy, and disorders of the eyes, ears, or nose. Headaches that occur without other symptoms and resolve within hours are usually not a cause for concern.

### Migraine Headaches

Migraine headaches are severe and throbbing, caused by narrowing and swelling of blood vessels in the head. Symptoms often include:

- Nausea.
- Vomiting.
- Intolerance to light and noise.

Migraines may last hours to days. Treatment includes headache medications and avoiding triggers.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

- Try these measures to relieve your headache:
  - Stretch and massage your shoulders, neck, jaw, and scalp.
  - Take a hot bath.
  - Rest with a warm, dry cloth, a cold wet cloth, or an ice pack wrapped in a towel over the aching area—use whichever feels better.
- Maintain regular meals; do not skip or delay meals.
- Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of liquids.
- Avoid alcohol and cigarette smoking, as they can worsen headaches.
- Get a good night’s sleep, which is often the best remedy.
- If you received a narcotic injection, avoid driving or tasks requiring alertness for 12 hours.
