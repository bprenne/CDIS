# Asthma (Adult)

Asthma occurs when the airways (breathing tubes) in your lungs become swollen and irritated, making it difficult to breathe. 

No one knows what causes asthma, but it can be triggered by:

- An allergy (e.g., dust, mold, pollen, animal dander).
- An irritant (e.g., smoke, pollution, strong fumes, perfume).
- A reaction to a medicine.
- Heavy exercise.
- A cold or chest infection.
- Emotions (e.g., anger, anxiety).
- Changes in air temperature.

Once you have asthma, it is a lifelong condition. Your family doctor can help you manage asthma, control it, and limit attacks.

### Tips for Living with Asthma:

- Inform any new healthcare professional about your asthma.
- Wear a medical identification tag (Medical Alert) to let others know about your asthma.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

- Rest.
- Take medicine(s) as directed.
- Have someone stay with you or check on you today.
- Make an appointment to see your family doctor within 24 to 48 hours.
- Protect yourself from things that can trigger an attack.

## When to Get Help

### Call 9-1-1 if you:

- Suddenly experience:
  - Shortness of breath.
  - Severe wheezing.
  - Severe coughing.
  - Chest tightness.
- Do not get relief from your inhaler medicine.
- Cannot speak because you cannot catch your breath.
- Notice your lips or fingers turning blue.

### See your family doctor if you:

- Are short of breath with activity.
- Become wheezy when resting.
- Find it hard to walk or talk due to breathing.

### Additional Tip:
