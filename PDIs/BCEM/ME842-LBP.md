# Lower Back Pain

Lower back pain is one of the most common reasons people visit healthcare providers. The good news is that the pain often resolves on its own, with most people recovering in a week or two. Contrary to popular belief, staying in bed for extended periods can delay recovery.

### Key Points:
- Bed rest is generally not recommended. Prolonged bed rest can:
  - Increase pain and stiffness.
  - Cause muscle strength loss (20–30% within a week).
  - Slow down recovery.

- Staying active in a limited way and finding comfortable positions can help speed up recovery.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

### Managing Pain:
- Use hot or cold packs for relief.
- Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) may help. Consult your pharmacist or healthcare provider for guidance.

### Staying Active:
- Engage in light activities like walking or water aerobics. Exercise can often relieve lower back pain.
- Avoid activities that worsen pain. Start with low-impact exercises and gradually add more complex ones as you improve.

### Professional Help:
- Seek assessment and treatment from healthcare professionals like physiotherapists, chiropractors, or kinesiologists.
- Passive techniques such as heat, ice, ultrasound, or manipulation may be used initially.
- Focus on exercises that strengthen core and trunk muscles, such as:
  - Lifting light weights.
  - Yoga.
  - Walking or using a treadmill.
  - Water aerobics.

### Tips for Exercise:
- Avoid exercises like sit-ups with straight legs, leg lifts while lying down, and standing shoulder presses or bicep curls until improvement is noted.
- Joining a chronic back pain exercise program may provide motivation and guidance.

## When to Get Help

Go to the Emergency Department if you experience:
- Severe, continuous back pain not improving within 48 hours.
- Back pain accompanied by fever.
- Back pain with leg pain, numbness, or weakness, especially if leg symptoms are more disabling.
- Back pain with numbness in the genital area or changes in bowel/bladder control.

## Recommended Follow-Up
- Follow up with your primary care provider within 1–2 weeks.
