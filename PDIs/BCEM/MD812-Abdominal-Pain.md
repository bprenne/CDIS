# Abdominal Pain

There are many reasons for abdominal pain, not all of which are easily diagnosed in one visit to the ED. Your healthcare team has assessed you for possible serious or dangerous causes, and currently, it is safe for you to manage your symptoms at home. However, symptoms can change, and it is important to recognize reasons to return to the ED for reassessment.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

- Take your temperature every four (4) hours over the next 12 hours.
- Drink clear fluids like water, herbal tea, or clear broth for the first 24 hours. You can also drink decaffeinated sports/electrolyte drinks. Aim for 8 glasses of water a day.
- Once your pain is gone, eat bland foods (BRAT diet) like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. Consider soups/congee, cooked cereals, crackers, and plain baked potatoes.
- **Try to avoid**:
  - Spicy foods, bran (too much fiber), candy, or dairy products.
  - Alcohol, milk, or drinks with caffeine (e.g., coffee, cola, tea, Red Bull, etc.).
- Take the medicines the Emergency doctor has recommended you take.

## When to Get Help

Go to the nearest Emergency Department if you are experiencing any of the following new issues:
- Pain getting worse despite home care, or it is now only in one specific area.
- New pain in your chest, neck, or shoulder.
- Difficulty breathing, and this is new for you.
- Throwing up (vomiting) so often that you cannot keep anything down, especially if it has what looks like blood or coffee grounds in it.
- Blood in the toilet when you poo (have a bowel movement) or when you pee (urinate). Blood can also appear as black, tarry stools.
- Fever over 38.5°C (101.3°F).
- Loose/liquid poo (diarrhea) that is not going away.
- Your abdomen is stiff, hard, and tender to touch.
- You cannot go poo (have a bowel movement) no matter how much you try, and you start throwing up.
- For men: sharp pain in the scrotum or testicle.
- You are not able to go pee (urinate).

## Recommended Follow-Up

- Follow up with your primary care provider in 1 week.
