# Influenza (Flu)

Influenza, or the flu, is an acute infection of the upper airway caused by influenza A or B viruses. It can lead to complications such as viral or bacterial pneumonia, particularly in high-risk groups like seniors, young children, pregnant women, and those with chronic health conditions or weakened immune systems.

### Symptoms
- Fever, headache, and muscle pain.
- Runny nose and sore throat.
- Extreme tiredness and cough.
- Children may also experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Symptoms begin 1–4 days after exposure (average: 2 days) and usually last 7–10 days. Cough and weakness may persist for 1–2 weeks longer.

## How Can You Prevent Influenza?
- Wash hands regularly with soap and water.
- Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
- Dispose of used tissues promptly.
- Cough and sneeze into your shirt sleeve rather than your hands.
- Stay home if you are ill.
- Get the influenza vaccine to reduce your risk of infection and spreading the virus.

## How Does Influenza Spread?
- Through coughing, sneezing, or face-to-face contact.
- By touching contaminated surfaces and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.
- Adults can spread the virus 1 day before symptoms appear and up to 5 days after they start. Children may spread the virus for a longer period.

## Home Treatment
- Get plenty of rest and drink extra fluids.
- Avoid smoking and exposure to smoke.
- Use moist air from a hot shower or sink to ease a stuffy nose.
- Prescription antivirals may help if started within 48 hours of symptom onset.
- Avoid non-prescription cough and cold medications for children under 6 years.

## When to Get Help
- Contact your healthcare provider if you are at high risk of complications or if symptoms worsen.
- Seek immediate medical attention for:
  - Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
  - Chest pain.
  - Signs of dehydration (e.g., dizziness, low urine output).

## Is it Influenza or a Cold?
Influenza symptoms are generally more severe and last longer than those of a cold.

## Recommended Follow-Up
- Follow up with your primary care provider within 1 week.
