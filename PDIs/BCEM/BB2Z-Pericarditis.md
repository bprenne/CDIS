# Pericarditis

Pericarditis is a condition where the pericardium, the thin sac surrounding the heart, becomes swollen or inflamed. This inflammation can affect the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.

## Causes
- Viral or bacterial infections.
- Heart attack.
- Injury or surgery to the chest or heart.
- Weakened immune system.

## Symptoms
- Chest pain (often on the left side or center) that may:
  - Be dull, sharp, or aching.
  - Worsen with coughing, swallowing, deep breaths, lying down, or rolling over.
- Pain radiating to the neck or left shoulder.
- Shortness of breath.
- Fatigue.
- Fever with chills.
- Cough or nausea.

## Diagnosis

- **Heart and lung sounds**: A 'grating' or 'rubbing' sound may be heard with a stethoscope.
- **Tests**:
  - **Chest X-ray**: Checks for fluid buildup or an enlarged heart.
  - **Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)**: Assesses heart rhythm and strain.
  - **Echocardiogram**: Uses ultrasound to evaluate heart function and detect fluid in the sac.
  - **Blood tests**: Identifies infection or inflammation.

## Treatment
- **Medications**:
  - Anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce swelling and pain.
- **Rest**:
  - Avoid strenuous activities until symptoms resolve.
- **Fluid removal**:
  - If excess fluid builds up in the heart sac, a procedure may be needed to drain it using a needle and local anesthetic.

Pericarditis usually resolves within weeks or months with proper treatment.

## When to Get Help

### Emergency:
Go to the nearest Emergency Department or call 9-1-1 if:

- Fever over 38.5°C (101.3°F) persists despite medication.
