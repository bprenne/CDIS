# Angina

We have determined that your chest pain is coming from your heart. This is called angina. Angina is caused by not enough oxygen getting to your heart muscle.

When your heart muscle does not have enough oxygen, it can cause you to have angina, or worse, it could result in a heart attack. A heart attack is when the blood flow to a part of your heart muscle is blocked. When this happens, heart muscle is damaged.

## Is It Angina or a Heart Attack?

Most people who have been told they have angina get to know the pattern of their angina attacks and have a home treatment plan from their care provider.

If the angina pain changes or pain in your chest is new or different (crushing, squeezing, or heaviness in the chest), you could be having a heart attack.

## Symptoms

You could be having a heart attack if you experience:
- A crushing or squeezing feeling in the chest.
- A heavy weight on the chest.

You may also notice any of these symptoms:
- Pain spreading to the arm, shoulder, neck, and jaw.
- Stomach or belly pain.
- Sweating.
- Trouble getting your breath.
- Feeling sick to your stomach (nausea) or throwing up (vomiting).
- Feeling dizzy or light-headed.
- Changes in your heartbeat (fast, slow, or irregular).
- Feeling very weak or tired.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

If you have been told you have angina and you and your care provider have made a home treatment plan for how to deal with your angina attacks, follow that plan.
