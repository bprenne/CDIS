# Bell’s Palsy

Bell’s palsy occurs when there is inflammation that causes damage to a nerve on one side of the face. While the exact cause is unknown, some experts believe it may result from an infection. This nerve damage may cause:

- Sudden weakness or paralysis on one side of your face, causing it to droop (the main symptom). It may make it hard to close your eye on the affected side.
- Drooling.
- Eye problems, such as excessive tearing or a dry eye.
- Loss of ability to taste.
- Pain in or behind your ear.
- Numbness in the affected side of your face.
- Increased sensitivity to sound.

Most people recover from Bell’s palsy within three to six months. Younger individuals are more likely to experience complete recovery. In some cases, symptoms may not fully resolve.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

- If you have been prescribed an anti-viral medication and a steroid, fill the prescription as soon as possible. Starting your medications early increases the likelihood of full recovery.
- If you cannot close your eye completely on the affected side:
  - Use artificial tears during the daytime and artificial tear ointment at night to prevent your eye from drying out.
  - Consider using soft eye pads at night. After applying artificial tear ointment to the lower lid of the affected eye, close your eyelid fully with your fingers and place the pad over the closed eye. Secure it with medical tape diagonally from your forehead to your cheek.
- During the daytime, protect your eyes by wearing large protective eyewear, such as sunglasses, to shield against foreign objects since blinking may be incomplete.
- Practice good mouth care. If you have reduced feeling or saliva on one side of your tongue:
  - Brush and floss your teeth frequently to prevent gum disease or tooth decay.
  - Eat slowly, chew food well, and consider soft, smooth foods like yogurt to avoid swallowing difficulties.

## When to Get Help

Go to the nearest Emergency Department if you experience:
- Fever and headache.
- New neurological symptoms, such as changes in your arms, legs, the other side of your face, or balance.

## Recommended Follow-Up

- Follow up with your primary care provider within 7-10 days.
