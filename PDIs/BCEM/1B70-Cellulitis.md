# Cellulitis

Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and soft tissue, usually caused by bacteria. Bacteria can enter through minor scrapes, cuts, scratches, bites, or dry hands, feet, or nails.

### Common Symptoms of Cellulitis:
- Redness.
- Swelling.
- Pain.
- Warmth.
- Rash-like appearance.
- Fever or chills.
- Nausea or vomiting.

With appropriate treatment, the infection should improve. Treatment may involve oral antibiotics or, in some cases, antibiotics delivered by IV.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

- Take medications exactly as prescribed by your doctor and finish the course, even if you feel better.
- If the infection is on an arm or leg, rest it on a pillow to help reduce swelling.
- Avoid pools and hot tubs during treatment.
- If there is any drainage from the infected area:
  - Keep the area covered with the dressing recommended by your nurse or doctor.
  - Wash your hands before and after caring for the infected area.
  - When changing the bandage at home, wrap the old bandage in a plastic bag and dispose of it in the garbage.

## Go to the nearest Emergency Department if you experience:

- Severe or worsening pain.
- Blisters or dark purple areas on the skin.
- Red streaks coming from the infected area or an increase in redness size.
- Fever over 38Â°C.
- Chills or sweating.
- Nausea or vomiting.
- Stiffness in nearby joints.

## Ways to Prevent Cellulitis

- Clean breaks in the skin thoroughly with soap and water.
- Protect any breaks in the skin with a bandage.
- If you have diabetes, examine your feet and legs daily for breaks in the skin.
