# How to Take Out Stitches

Follow these steps to remove your stitches safely:

## Steps for Removal

1. Prepare your supplies (bandages, tweezers, scissors, etc.).
2. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
3. Gently clean the stitches and wound area with warm soapy water and a clean facecloth.
4. Open the provided package containing special scissors and tweezers.
5. Use tweezers to hold the knot of the stitch. If difficult, hold the knot with your fingers.
6. Slip the curved edge of the scissors under the stitch and cut the string. Avoid cutting the knot itself.
7. Pull the knot and stitch out completely.
8. Repeat the process for each stitch.
9. Clean the area again with warm soapy water.
10. Pat the area dry.

## After Removing the Stitches

- **Day 1**: Place a bandage over the area and leave it on for a day.
- **Day 2**: Remove the bandage, check the area for healing or signs of infection, and apply a clean bandage for another day.
- **Day 3**: Remove the bandage and leave the area uncovered.

**Important**: Wash your hands before and after every bandage change.

## What to Expect

- A small amount of bleeding from where the stitch came through the skin is normal.

## When to Get Help

See your family doctor if:

- You cannot remove all stitches or notice pieces of stitches remaining.
- Bleeding persists for more than 30 minutes.
- The wound reopens and is more than Â¼ inch (0.5 cm) wide.
- Thick, colored pus comes from the wound.
- The skin around the wound becomes red, hot, and sore to touch.

## Recommended Follow-Up

- Follow up with your primary care provider if you have any concerns.
