# Gallstones

Gallstones are hard, stone-like deposits that form in the gallbladder. They can range in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball.

### What is the Gallbladder?
The gallbladder is a small sac in your abdomen, located between your stomach and liver. It stores bile, a fluid made by the liver that helps digest fats. Gallstones may pass unnoticed, but larger ones can block the flow of bile, causing pain when stuck.

## How Do You Know You Have Gallstones?

### Signs and Symptoms:
- Pain in:
  - Your stomach.
  - The upper right abdomen under the ribs.
  - The back between the shoulder blades.
  - Under the right shoulder.
- Pain may be sharp, dull, cramp-like, constant, or intermittent, lasting from minutes to hours.
- Nausea or vomiting.
- Fever and loss of appetite if the gallbladder becomes inflamed or infected.

### What Triggers Gallstone Attacks?
Gallbladder attacks often occur suddenly, usually after eating fatty foods or at night.

## How to Care for Yourself at Home

### To Treat Pain:
- Use over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).
- Take prescription pain medication if provided by your doctor.

### To Prevent Gallbladder Attacks:
- Eat small meals 3–4 times daily; do not skip meals.
- Choose low-fat, high-fibre foods (vegetables, fruits, whole grains).
- Use low-fat dairy products (e.g., yogurt, cheese, milk).
- Cook with healthy oils (e.g., canola, olive, soybean).
- Replace butter with non-hydrogenated margarine.
- Drink low-calorie beverages.
- Limit alcohol to one drink per day if you choose to consume it.

Maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise and a balanced diet can reduce the risk of gallstones. Avoid rapid weight loss or fad diets, as they increase the likelihood of developing gallstones.

## When to Get Help

### Go to the Emergency Department if:
- Pain lasts more than 3 hours or does not improve with pain medicine.
- Vomiting persists.
- You have chills or a fever over 38.0°C (100.4°F).

### See Your Doctor or Visit a Walk-In Clinic if:
- You experience an attack of steady pain lasting 30 minutes to a few hours.
- You notice yellowish skin or eyes (jaundice), with or without pain.
