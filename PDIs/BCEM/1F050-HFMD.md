# Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by certain viruses and is most common in children under 10 years of age, though older children and adults can also be affected. Most cases occur in the summer and early fall.

### Symptoms
- Symptoms begin 3–5 days after contact with an infected person.
- Initial signs:
  - Mild fever.
  - Runny nose or sore throat.
  - Tiredness and loss of appetite.
- Blisters and red spots:
  - Painful blisters inside the mouth, on the tongue, or gums (appear about 2 days after fever starts).
  - Small red spots may develop on the palms, soles, and buttocks, possibly forming blisters (1–2 days after mouth symptoms).
  - Symptoms typically resolve within 7–10 days.
- Other symptoms:
  - Peeling skin and temporary loss of fingernails or toenails (rare).

Not everyone will have all symptoms, and it is possible to have the infection without symptoms.

## How Does It Spread?
- Contagious for about 7–10 days while symptoms are present.
- Spread through:
  - Close contact (e.g., kissing, sharing utensils).
  - Airborne droplets from coughs or sneezes.
  - Contact with fluid from blisters or feces.
- The virus can remain in the bowels for weeks after symptoms resolve.
- Pregnant women can pass the virus to newborns, who usually have mild symptoms.

## How Can You Prevent It?
- Practice good hygiene during and after infection:
  - Wash hands often with soap and warm water.
  - Teach children to sneeze or cough into a tissue or elbow.
  - Dispose of tissues and wash hands after use.
  - Avoid daycare or school if contagious, though the risk is low if hygiene is maintained.
- Clean surfaces and shared toys regularly:
  - Disinfect surfaces with a bleach solution (1 tbsp bleach per 1 L water).
  - Use a weaker solution for toys (1 tsp bleach per 1 L water).

## How Is It Treated?
- Use acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol®) for fever or soreness (consult dosage instructions).
- **Do not use ASA or Aspirin®** for children under 20 years due to the risk of Reye Syndrome.
- Leave blisters alone; do not pop them.
- For mouth pain, give:
  - Cold, bland liquids (e.g., milk, water).
  - Soft, cool foods (e.g., bread, noodles, peanut butter and jelly).
  - Avoid fizzy drinks, tart juices, acidic, or spicy foods.

## Recommended Follow-Up
- Follow up with your primary care provider within 1 week.
